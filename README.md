This is a clone of the AirBnB website console.
The command interpreter, once run, only needs one argument to do stuff. 
If you type "help" it will list you the available commands. If you type 
"help <cmd>" then it will show a brief explanation of what the command does

examples:
(hbnb) help >>> outputs list of available commands
(hbnb) help quit  >>> outputs information about the quit command
(hbnb) CTRL-D >>> pressing control-D will exit the program
(hbnb) quit >>> typing quit also exists the program
