This is a clone of the AirBnB website console.
The command interpreter, once run, only needs one argument to do stuff. 
If you type "help" it will list you the available commands. If you type 
"help <cmd>" then it will show a brief explanation of what the command does

examples:
(hbnb) help
(hbnb) help quit  >>> outputs information about the quit command
(hbnb) quit >>> exists the program
